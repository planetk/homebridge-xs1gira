# homebridge-xs1gira

This is a experimental plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge). It provides access to a Gira Funkbus Switches and Dimmers attached to a EzControl XS1.
 
Implementation is based on my personal needs and may not fit your needs.

# Configuration

## Example

 ```
"platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "xs1gira",
            "name" : "Funkbus",
            "host" : "192.168.1.111",
        }
    ]

}

```
